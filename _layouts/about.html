    <div class="text">
      <p>Hi! My name is Rachel Heo, a freelance UI & UX designer who is based in Vancouver and Seoul.</p>

      <p>I have a passion for creating beautiful, intuitive, 
    and highly crafted designs combining a considered approach with emerging technologies. I have wide ranging skills in designing from web and mobile interfaces to prints and logos.</p>

      <p>My strengths lie in my attention to detail, the ability to refine complex requirements and information into simple and elegant solutions. I am not interested in simply “ticking the boxes” and churning out average designs. I want to make sure that everything I produce is something that I would be excited about if I were the client. I love what I do and I do what I love, and it makes me want to always outdo myself and seek out new challenges. </p>
